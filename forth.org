* cForth
  Another basic forth.
  In C because fuck you.
  Planned to be merged in an OS.
  So need to have basic function decoupled from the rest.
  As much as possible.

** Ideas
** Parsing
   None. Eval directly after ' '.
   Is this doable?

** Words (I think) I need
*** if
*** then
*** else
*** :
*** ;
*** emit
*** >
*** <
*** and
*** or
*** xor
*** =
*** >=
*** <=
*** not
*** !
*** @
*** .
*** .s
*** create
*** allot
*** ,
*** '
*** drop
*** dup
*** over
*** push
*** pop
*** r>
*** >r
*** r@
*** r!
